# TimeTable-Generator
Timetable generation is a crucial task in educational institutions, and automating this process can save time and improve efficiency. This project focuses on developing a timetable generator using a genetic algorithm, addressing the gap in the field for an automated solution that considers multiple constraints and preferences.

## Features
### Automated Timetable Generation:
Utilizes a genetic algorithm to automatically generate optimized timetables.
### Constraint Handling:
Considers course clashes, room capacities, and instructor availability to ensure feasibility.
### Efficiency:
Streamlines the timetable generation process, saving time and resources for educational institutions.
### Practical Implementation:
Offers a practical solution for educational institutions to create accurate and feasible timetables.

## Usage
Once the program is running, follow the on-screen instructions to input necessary parameters such as course details, room capacities, and instructor availability. The timetable generator will then utilize the genetic algorithm to generate optimized timetables based on the provided constraints.

## Results
The results of the timetable generation process demonstrate the effectiveness of the program in producing accurate and feasible timetables. These results highlight the potential for practical implementation in educational institutions, offering an automated approach to streamline the timetable generation process.

## Contributing
Contributions to the project are welcome! Feel free to submit issues, feature requests, or pull requests to help improve the functionality and usability of the timetable generator.
